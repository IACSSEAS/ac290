### Extreme computing
Predictive computer simulations will play a critical role in scientific discoveries, national competitiveness, and in solving societal problems. For such predictions of real problems, the ability to scale the solution techniques, algorithms, and software to large-scale is necessary.  Extreme Computing deals with the principles, systems, and algorithms, so that practical problems can be  simulated.  This course will explore the technologies and techniques used for distributed scientific computing and practices used by companies for their business needs such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft using existing large-scale computing resources.  In addition, the course will identify three areas from physical, natural and social sciences that could be addressed by these techniques. The course will be divided in three modules and each module will cover three parts: the principles behind extreme computing (distributed cloud computing, scaling, performance, privacy etc), supporting infrastructure (distributed file systems, replication, web services etc) and algorithms (MapReduce etc).
