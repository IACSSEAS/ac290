Title: Policies
Author: Pavlos Protopapas

### General Policy

It is strongly recommended that you attend all the tutorials, as they will be fun. You will learn and work hands-on on advanced topics during the tutorials. Tutorial notes and notebooks will be posted online, but do not expect all the material talked about in class, as well as questions posed and their answers to be in these notes. 

There will be a piazza page for all discussions and announcements. Participation in these discussions counts 8% towards your grade. The Piazza discussion will revolve around tutorial subjects and elements of your project.

Students are encouraged to talk about their projects, difficulties and all, on the forum. Students are encouraged even more to engage with students doing other projects: we promise it will make your experience more fun, and your knowledge base larger.

All code and data (of reasonable size) used for the project must also be submitted. This may be in ipython notebooks, or separate files. If data is large, tell us where to find it. If its proprietary, talk to us ahead of time.


### Course Grade


Your course grade is calculated as:

* phase 1: 15
* phase 2: 15
* phase 3: 15
* phase 4: 25
* presentation+deliverables: presentation+paper/report/software-with-docs+site+video:20
* participation: 5 (piazza discussions, attendance at tutorial)s
* teamwork: 5 (as peer evaluated as well as evaluated by us)

There will be a piazza page for all discussions and announcements. 

Remember that you will be graded on all the 4 phases of your project talked about in [syllabus](/syllabus). 

Note that there is 5% grade for teamwork. This depends on your own self-evaluation as well as the evaluation of your contribution by your teammates. 

The dropbox for the project will close on the deadline for that piece of work. NO work will be accepted after the deadline. Do not submit in the last seconds before the dropbox closes.

###Deliverables 

1. Final report (group)
2. Final presentation (group, one or more students may give the presentation)
2. Self evaluation (individual)
3. Peer evaluation (individual)
4. Project website (group): Students will develop a web page which briefly describes their project and includes a demonstration video (below). 
5. Project video (group): Each group will create a three minute screencast with narration showing a demo of their work.  

Deliverable should be in a github repository, with 2 branches: `master` for paper/software/report and `gh-pages` (see Github Pages for how to create this) for website/video.

### Originality and Plagiarization

You must do your own work, we have zero-tolerance for plagiarization. 

You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. However, you are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise!

You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and in any publicly visible material. 

If you have any doubts about whether a library is ok to use in your work, please direct your question to one of the TFs.


### Accommodations for students with disabilities:

Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with me by the end of the second week of the term to identify, discuss, and document any feasible instructional modifications or accommodations. Students from the extension school should contact the extension school disability office, see [here](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources/disability-services). Failure to do so may result in inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although I may contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation.
